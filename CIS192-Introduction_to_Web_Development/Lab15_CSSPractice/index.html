         Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.
      </div>

      <div>
         Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.
      </div>

      <div id="orange">
         Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.
      </div>

      <div id="orange-red">
         Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
